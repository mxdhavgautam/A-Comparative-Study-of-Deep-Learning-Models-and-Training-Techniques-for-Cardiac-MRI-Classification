# A Comparative Study of Deep Learning Models and Training Techniques for Cardiac MRI Classification
 This repository presents a comparative study of deep learning models (MobileNetV2, ResNet152V2, DenseNet201, InceptionV3) for classifying Normal vs. Sick Cardiac MRI images from a public Kaggle dataset (~63k images, ~1.5:1 ratio after processing). It includes implementations using transfer learning, data augmentation, class weighting, spatial attention, and ensemble averaging. The repository contains the Jupyter notebook for sequential training/evaluation, saved model checkpoints (.keras), training/evaluation plots, and the accompanying research paper, providing a comprehensive resource for automated CMRI analysis using CNNs.
